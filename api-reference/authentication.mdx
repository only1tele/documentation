title: Authentication
hide-feedback: true

The HashRails API uses API keys for authentication, and every request to the API must include your API key to authenticate your requests.

All API requests should include your API key in an `x-api-key` HTTP header as follows:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Making requests

You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace `$YOUR_API_KEY` with your secret API key.

```bash
curl 'https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/recipients' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: $YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Example with curl:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/recipients' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```
