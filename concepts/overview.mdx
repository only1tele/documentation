## Introduction

HashRails API is a comprehensive financial operations platform designed to provide secure, scalable, and efficient solutions for businesses. This overview covers the core concepts, architecture, and key features that make up the HashRails API ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

### Virtual Accounts

Virtual accounts are temporary or permanent bank account numbers that allow you to receive payments from customers without needing a physical bank account. They're perfect for:

- **E-commerce platforms**: Accept payments from customers
- **Marketplace applications**: Collect fees and commissions
- **SaaS applications**: Handle subscription payments
- **Freelance platforms**: Manage escrow and payments

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="USD Virtual Accounts" icon="dollar-sign">
    - US banking integration
    - ACH and wire transfer support
    - Real-time transaction notifications
    - KYC verification required
  </Card>
  <Card title="NGN Virtual Accounts" icon="naira-sign">
    - Multiple provider support
    - Local bank transfer support
    - Instant settlement
    - No KYC required for basic accounts
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Transactions

Transactions represent the movement of money through the HR API system. They can be:

- **Incoming**: Payments received into virtual accounts
- **Outgoing**: Transfers sent to recipients
- **Internal**: Account-to-account transfers
- **Exchange**: Currency conversions

<Info>
All transactions are tracked with unique references and provide real-time status updates through webhooks and WebSocket connections.
</Info>

### Customers

Customers are the end users of your application who interact with financial services. The HR API provides:

- **KYC/KYB verification**: Through integrated providers like Sumsub
- **Customer management**: Create, update, and track customer information
- **Verification workflows**: Automated compliance checks
- **Document management**: Secure storage of verification documents

### Recipients

Recipients are the destinations for outgoing payments. They can be:

- **Crypto recipients**: Blockchain addresses for cryptocurrency transfers
- **Fiat recipients**: Bank accounts for traditional currency transfers
- **Internal recipients**: Other users within your platform

## API Architecture

### RESTful Design

HR API follows REST principles with:

- **Resource-based URLs**: Clear, predictable endpoint structure
